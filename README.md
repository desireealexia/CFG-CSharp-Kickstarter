# C# Kickstarter Course - Code First Girls

This repository contains my work from the CFG C# Kickstarter course. The course focused on learning the fundamentals of C# with an emphasis on web development using the .NET framework. It also included practical applications, such as creating a budget tracker as both a console app and a web app.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course consisted of eight modules covering the following topics:

1. **Hello, World!** - Introduction to C# and setting up the environment  
2. **Data Types and Variables** - Understanding C# data types and how to use variables  
3. **Comparisons** – Working with conditionals and logical operators  
4. **Loops, Methods and Object-Oriented Programming** – Using loops, writing methods, and an intro to OOP  
5. **Web Development (1)** – Starting to build a web app with .NET  
6. **Web Development (2)** – Expanding the web app functionality  
7. **Recap** – Summary of everything learned  
8. **Reflection and Next Steps** – Final thoughts and advice for continued learning

## 🛠️ Projects

### 💻 Budget Tracker Console App

A simple console application developed gradually throughout the course. It applies core C# concepts such as:

- Variables and data types  
- Conditional statements  
- Loops and methods  
- Object-oriented programming  

### 🌐 Budget Tracker Web App

A mini web application built using:

- C#  
- ASP.NET  
- Razor Pages or MVC
- Basic frontend styling

## 🚀 How to Run

### Console App

1. Open the `BudgetTrackerConsoleApp` folder in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or VS Code)  
2. Build and run the application using the .NET CLI or IDE run tools  

```bash
dotnet run
```

### Web App

1. Navigate to the BudgetTrackerWebApp directory
2. Run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```
3. Open your browser and go to: `https://localhost:PORT`
(Replace `PORT` with the port number shown in your terminal)

## 💬 Reflections

This course helped solidify my understanding of core programming principles and gave me my first experience with backend web development. Building both console and web apps allowed me to apply my learning in a hands-on, practical way. I'm looking forward to continuing with full-stack development and expanding my knowledge in C#, .NET, and beyond.
